# Dead Simple Predictive Analytics Project for Sentiment Analysis on Education-related Tweets during COVID

## Introduction
In the era of COVID-19, education has become a hot topic, especially in the context of remote learning and its effectiveness. With the rise of social media, platforms like Twitter have become a valuable resource for gathering data and insights into people's opinions and sentiments regarding various topics, including education. This project aims to use predictive analytics to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of education-related tweets during COVID-19.

## Methodology
The methodology for this project is straightforward and can be easily replicated by anyone with basic knowledge of Python and the necessary libraries. The steps are as follows:

1. Collect a dataset of education-related tweets during COVID-19 using the Twitter API.
2. Preprocess the data by cleaning the tweets, removing stop words, and tokenizing the text.
3. Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, such as Vader or TextBlob, to classify the sentiment of each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. Visualize the sentiment distribution of the tweets using a pie chart or bar graph.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Twitter API
- Tweepy (Python library for accessing the Twitter API)
- Pandas (Python library for data manipulation)
- NLTK (Python library for natural language processing)


## Results and Discussion
The results of this project will depend on the dataset of tweets collected and the sentiment analysis model used. However, the goal of this project is not to achieve state-of-the-art performance on sentiment analysis but rather to provide a dead simple example of how predictive analytics can be used for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

With the results obtained, one can explore the sentiment of tweets regarding education during COVID-19, understand how people are reacting to it, and identify key areas of concern or praise. This information can be used to improve education policies or address any concerns related to remote learning during the pandemic.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective way to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to education during COVID-19 using predictive analytics. It can serve as a starting point for more advanced sentiment analysis projects or for exploring other topics on social media.
